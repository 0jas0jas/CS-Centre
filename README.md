## How do I upload my notes/resources?

You can upload a wide variety to resources to CS Centre ranging from personal notes, PowerPoint Presentations, Websites and PDFs.

To upload your own resources follow the following simple steps:

### Step 1

On our [GitHub Page](https://github.com/HC-Byte-Club/CS-Centre), find the "content/post" directory

### Step 2

Click on the `Add file` > `Create new file` button

### Step 3

In the new file, copy and paste the following boilerplate:

``` yml
---
title: "Informative Title"
date: 2023-03-25T12:55:37+05:30 (this date format is an example, replace the numbers with your respective date/time)
draft: false
tags: ["SQL", "Programming Languages", "Database"]
categories: ["Database"] 
---


//YOUR CONTENT GOES HERE//


```

You can start typing or putting in links to your resources in the `//YOUR CONTENT GOES HERE//` section. Please use appropiate tags so your resource is easy to navigate to. Choose **ONE** category, which suits the subject of your resource, from the following catagories:

- Information representation
- Networking
- Hardware
- Logic Gates
- Processor Fundamentals
- Assembly Language
- Language Translators
- Security, privacy and data integrity
- Ethics and Ownership
- Database
- Algorithm Design and Problem Solving
- Data Types and structures
- Programming
- Software Development
- Artificial Intelligence

### Step 4

You're done! Name your file appropiately (preferrably the `Informative Title` that you put in the last step) followed by a ".md"

For example, if the title of your Local Area Network Notes is "LAN for dummies" then the file name should be "LAN for dummies.md".

### Step 5

Scroll down and write an optional description and press `Commit new file`. Your file will be up as soon as one of the repository managers review it and push the changes.
